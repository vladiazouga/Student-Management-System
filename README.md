In this repo I created an ejs page to showcase http requests that were from the studentserver.js file
(I had to create a views folder for all the ejs files and I created a partials folder to hold the navbar)
Each EJS page has its own task:
- addStudent.ejs: create a new student. 
- updateStudent.ejs: update a student by ID 
- deleteStudent.ejs: delete a student by ID 
- displayStudent.ejs: display a single student by ID 
- listStudents.ejs: list all students records
